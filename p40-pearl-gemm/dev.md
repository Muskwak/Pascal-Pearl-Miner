# Dev log — Ada (sm_89) tensor-core kernel optimization

Goal: close the gap on the RTX 4050 (Ada, AD107, 20 SM) between our Ampere/Ada
tensor-core GEMM and the reference "ipminer" — **8 TH/s → ~25 TH/s**, staying
**bit-exact** with the DP4A transcript.

1 tile = 16×16×4096 = 2^20 "hashes"; **1 Mtile/s ≈ 1.05 TH/s**. One mining region
= 4096×4096×4096 (R=256) = 65536 tiles. 25 TH/s ≈ 23.8 Mtile/s ≈ 2.75 ms/region.

## Test rig & loop
- An RTX 4050 (Ada, sm_89) test box reached over SSH. Windows, CUDA 12.8, **no Nsight
  Compute** installed (so profiling is empirical, via kernel timings).
- Cross-compile here (CUDA 12.8 + VS2022, `-arch=sm_89 -cudart static -Xcompiler /MT`),
  `scp` the ~0.6 MB exe, run on the box. One cycle ≈ 1 min.
- `tests/bench_ampere.cu` — includes the DP4A ref (`pearl_gemm_only_sm61.cu`) and the
  TC kernel; does a **bit-exact transcript check** (256×256×4096 R256 vs DP4A) and times
  the TC GEMM + DP4A at the real region config + a config sweep. `tests/iter.ps1` =
  build→scp→run.

## Baseline (fused kernel, 32×64 default)
```
TC   : 7.725 ms/region -> 8.90 TH/s  (17.8 INT8 TOPS, ~18% of peak)
DP4A : 10.31 ms/region -> 6.66 TH/s
TC speedup vs DP4A: 1.34x   <-- abysmal for tensor cores (should be 3-5x)
```
GEMM-only 8.9 ≈ the end-to-end 8 TH/s the user measured → **the GEMM is the
bottleneck** (BLAKE3 + noise + host overhead ≈ 10%). So optimize the GEMM.

## Iterations

| # | Change | Result | Verdict |
|---|--------|--------|---------|
| 1 | Vectorize smem→reg packing: 24 byte-loads+shifts → 6 `uint32` loads per MMA pair | 8.90 → 8.92 | no-op — nvcc already vectorized; loads aren't the bottleneck |
| 2 | Config sweep (block/warp/stage/minb) | **64×64 s4 b3 = 10.67** vs 32×64 = 8.9; 64×128/128×64/32×128 ≈ 9.3 | **64×64 is +20%**; dispatcher was picking the worse 32×64 |
| 3 | Reorder dispatcher to prefer 64×64 | TC 8.9 → **10.3** (shipped) | ✅ free +20% in the real miner |
| 4 | **R-block-staged kernel** (stage full R=256 k-slice, ~10× fewer syncs, dynamic smem) | bit-exact but **5.2 TH/s (2× slower)** | ❌ 64 KB smem → 1 block/SM → occupancy collapse |
| 5 | **Wide kernel** — each warp computes **NT** adjacent 16×16 tiles → **NT·2 independent accumulator chains** (small 32-k smem kept) | NT2=13.0, NT4=14.6, NT8=16.7, **NT16=17.6** | ✅ **the real fix** — ILP, not occupancy/sync |
| 6 | **wide1** — same but 1 `__syncthreads`/k-tile (sw-pipeline, prefetch far stage) | NT8=16.8, NT16=16.8 | ❌ no gain — syncs were never the bottleneck |
| 7 | Wire **wide NT16 (64×256)** into the dispatcher (n%256,m%64), NT8 fallback | TC path **8.9 → 16.2 TH/s (2.41× DP4A)** | ✅ shipped in `launch_pearl_ampere` |
| 8 | **XOR-swizzle smem** (`kk ^ (((row>>2)&1)<<4)`) → conflict-free A/B frag loads, zero extra smem, bit-exact | NT16 17.6 → **18.0**; bank conflicts **35.7M → 0**, shared-ld wavefronts **72.6M → 37.0M** | ✅ shipped (`swz32`/`load_*_swz`) — small TH/s gain but unblocks ldmatrix |
| 9 | **Cache the dispatcher arch check** (was calling `cudaGetDeviceProperties` per region, ~0.3 ms) | TC path 16.3 → **16.7** (~8% host tax removed; real-miner per-region) | ✅ shipped |
| 10 | **ldmatrix loads, plain layout** (A `x4`→4 regs, B `x2`→2 regs, no `.trans`) | bit-exact; LSU pipe **61%→41%** but conflicts **back** (plain) → L1 72% → **17.7** (no net gain) | ❌ alone — each fix solves only half |
| 11 | **ldmatrix + swizzle** (swizzle the per-lane ldmatrix addr — 16-byte-row granularity matches) | conflicts **0**, LSU 47%, L1 60%, **tensor 37.6%→43%** → **19.9** (64×256) | ✅ the combo unblocks the tensor pipe |
| 12 | **Bigger block 128×256 s3** (8 warps share the B tile → amortize cp.async, cut `long_scoreboard`) | **21.1** (256×256 regresses: register spill, 1 blk) | ✅ shipped — dispatcher routes m%128,n%256 → `launch_ldm<128,256,8,1,16,3,1>` |

### Key insight — it was ILP all along
`mma(acc,a,b,acc)` makes each accumulator a **serial dependency chain**. The fused kernel
had only **2 chains/warp** (accL,accR) → the tensor pipe stalls on that 2-deep latency.
Giving each warp **NT·2** independent chains (NT=16 → 32) fills the pipe. Confirmed:
- Wide NT16 ≈ 2× fused, and wins **even at low occupancy** (ILP > occupancy).
- R-block (more k-staging, same 2 chains) and wide1 (fewer syncs) gave **nothing** → the
  bottleneck was never loads, syncs, or occupancy.

### Benchmark gotcha
TH/s must be computed from tiles **actually covered**: BM and BN must divide the region
(4096). NT∈{2,4,8,16} give BN∈{32,64,128,256} (valid); NT=10/12 (BN=160/192) silently
cover fewer tiles and *inflate* TH/s. The bench now flags non-dividing configs with `*`.

## Current best
**`ldm` kernel, 128×256 NT16 3-stage = 21.4 TH/s GEMM (42.8 INT8 TOPS, 3.17× DP4A)** —
bit-exact, shipped via the dispatcher. **2.67× the 8 TH/s baseline**, ~86% of ipminer's 25.
(Steady-state with warmed clocks; `time_tc` needs ~60 warmup iters or it reads ~18 cold —
the GPU boost clock ramps over the run, *not* a dispatcher overhead.)
The climb: 8.0 → 16.3 (ILP/wide) → 18.0 (swizzle) → 19.9 (ldmatrix+swizzle) → 21.4 (128×256).

## End-to-end split (measured)
BLAKE3 over the transcript = **0.025 ms/region**; GEMM = 4.22 ms. So GEMM is **99%**
of `pearl_pow_split`, and noise (amortized per row/col block) + host loop are the only
other costs. **The GEMM is essentially the whole end-to-end cost** — optimizing it is
exactly right, and end-to-end ≈ GEMM (minus ~10% fixed overhead).

## Profiled with Nsight Compute (ncu 2025.1) — the real bottleneck
`tests/prof.ps1` builds + scp's + runs `ncu` against a single clean launch (the bench's
`prof` mode launches the dispatcher once at 4096² → 1024 blocks). Wide NT16 **before**
the swizzle:
```
L1/TEX throughput 71%  (Memory 70%, "L1 bottleneck")   DRAM 2%  (L2 hit 97.6%)
Tensor pipe 36.5%  ("well-utilized, should NOT be a bottleneck")  — 2× headroom
Scheduler No-Eligible 80%   active warps/sched 1.98   Occupancy 16.7% (reg+smem limited, 2 blk/SM)
Stalls (per-issue): wait 2.51 | mio_throttle 2.45 | long_scoreboard 1.80 | math 0.91 | barrier 0.76
Bank conflicts 35.7M of 72.6M shared-ld wavefronts  (~49% are conflict replays!)
```
→ **L1/shared-load-bound**, tensor idle. The bank conflicts (iter 8) and the dispatcher
tax (iter 9) were the two findings. **After** the swizzle: conflicts **0**, wavefronts
**37.0M**, L1/TEX **61%**, mio_throttle **2.04**, tensor **37.6%** — but only +2.4% TH/s.

### Two co-limiters remain (the wall to 25 TH/s)
1. **LSU instruction count** — LSU pipe still **61%**, `mio_throttle` 2.04. ~68 `LDS.32`/k-step
   (1 A-frag = 4, + NT·2 B-frags × 2). **Next lever: `ldmatrix.sync`** — 1 instr fills a whole
   fragment (A: x4 → 4 regs; B: x2 → 2 regs), ~2× fewer load instrs. The swizzle is a
   prerequisite (ldmatrix also wants conflict-free smem). Risk: must reproduce the exact
   mma s8 fragment layout (.b16 reinterpret + `.trans` for col-major B) — bit-exact or revert.
2. **Latency under low occupancy** — `wait` 2.31 + `long_scoreboard` 1.62 + `barrier` 0.71 = 4.6,
   with only ~2 warps/sched (16.5% occ, NT=16 accumulators = 128 int32 regs → 2 blk/SM).
   Empirically *can't* be fixed by lowering NT: NT8 (½ the regs) = 17.96 ≈ NT16 18.0, so the
   ILP gain from big NT cancels the occupancy gain from small NT. ILP ≥ occupancy here.

So 25 TH/s likely needs **ldmatrix AND** an occupancy/latency win; ldmatrix alone ≈ 20–22 est.

### Outcome (confirmed) + what's left to 25
ldmatrix+swizzle landed at **21.4** (iter 10–12) — both predictions held: ldmatrix alone was a
wash (conflicts returned), the combo unblocked the tensor pipe (37.6→43%), and the bigger
128×256 block's B-amortization cut `long_scoreboard`. After iter 12 the kernel is still
**latency-bound under 16.5% occupancy** (`wait` ~2.2 + `long_scoreboard` ~2.0, tensor ~43%).
The remaining ~16% to 25 needs an **occupancy win that doesn't cost ILP** — the only real lever
left is **dynamic shared memory** (`cudaFuncAttributeMaxDynamicSharedMemorySize`, up to 100 KB on
Ada vs the 48 KB static cap) to fit more stages/blocks per SM.

### Dynamic smem + carveout sweep (iter 13) — explored, does NOT beat 21.1
Built `pearl_ampere_ldm_dyn_kernel` (single `extern __shared__`, manual pipe+transcript offsets)
+ a `carveout` knob. Findings on the 4050 (Ada = 128 KB unified L1/shared, shared ≤100 KB):
- **Deeper pipelines** (128×256 s4/s5/s6, 1 block) — no gain (20.4–20.9 < 21.1); s3 already hides it.
- **Occupancy 2nd block** needs a bigger shared carveout; the L1↔shared **knee** is real:
  `64×256 s2` co0/32 = 1 blk = **15.0**, co50/64 = 2 blk (+64 KB L1) = **19.9**, co100 (28 KB L1) = 19.1.
  So mid-carveout (your "somewhere in the middle") *is* best among 2-block configs — but it tops out
  at **19.9 < 21.1**, because `128×256 s3` already reaches the same **8 warps/SM** AND all 8 warps
  share one B tile (amortizing cp.async), which the 2×`64×256` blocks don't.
### WARPS_N occupancy sweep (iter 14) — falsifies the register-frugal redesign
The kernel already has a `WARPS_N` param: WN>1 makes WN warps cooperate on the same 256-wide
block, each holding **NT/WN** accumulators — i.e. the exact "register-frugal" split (fewer regs/warp
→ more warps/SM) with **no rewrite**. Swept it (all bit-exact):
- 128×256 **WN1** NT16 (8 warps/SM) = **21.1**  ← still best
- 128×256 WN2 NT8 (16 warps/SM) = 19.4 ;  WN4 NT4 (32 warps/SM) = 18.4
- 64×256 WN2 NT8 = 16.5
**More occupancy consistently HURTS** — each warp loses ILP, and this kernel is **ILP-bound, not
occupancy-bound**. So the register-frugal redesign would land *below* 21.1; its premise is
empirically false. (Note: target is Ada/sm_89 RTX 4050 — AD107, 20 SM, 128 KB L1+shared/SM. The
`ampere`/`sm_80+` naming is just the tensor-core ISA baseline Ada inherits.)

**Conclusion: 21.4 TH/s (static 128×256 NT16 s3) is the firm structural ceiling.** Every
occupancy/register lever (dynamic smem, carveout, WARPS_N) makes it worse; every ILP/load lever
(ILP, swizzle, ldmatrix, B-amortization) is spent. ipminer's ~27 must come from a different
algorithm or hand-tuned SASS, not from tuning this design. **21.4 bit-exact is the shipping kernel.**

## Invariant
Every change must keep `bench_ampere.exe` reporting **BIT-EXACT PASS** (TC transcript ==
DP4A transcript). A correctness regression = revert.
